After nearly a year of soul searching, he finally decided that web development seemed to be an ideal career path for him.</p>
                <p>He eneded up lucking out, as a global pandemic ended up shutting down all production for quite some time, enabling him to collect unemplyment while taking a full stack web development class at the North Avenue Trade School. After a week and a half of taking it, he is thriving in the environment, and is very happy about his choice and excited to see where this career takes him.</p>
                <p>In his leisure time, he plays clarinet in the Seed and Feed Marching Aominable, a local street band based in Little Five Points. He also collects LEGOs, and has amassed a quite extensive and expensive collection since he started collecting again in 2015.</p>
